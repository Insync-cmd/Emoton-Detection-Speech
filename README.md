# Emotion Detection through Human Verbal Expression Using Deep Learning Techniques

This repository contains the research paper **"Emotion Detection through Human Verbal Expression Using Deep Learning Techniques"** presented at SCEECS22 Conference. The study explores the use of Deep Learning techniques for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), feature extraction methods, and dataset augmentation.

## 📑 Abstract
Detecting emotions from speech signals is a crucial yet intricate aspect of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Traditional SER approaches rely on handcrafted acoustic features and classical machine learning models, while our research leverages **Deep Learning** techniques such as **CNNs**, **ResNet-34**, and **custom CNN architectures** for higher accuracy. Using datasets such as **RAVDESS, TESS, SAVEE, and CREMA-D**, our proposed CNN model achieved **93.4% accuracy**, surpassing several state-of-the-art methods.

## 🔬 Key Highlights
- Utilized **spectrograms** and **MFCCs** for feature extraction.
- Applied **data augmentation** techniques to improve generalization.
- Compared classical models (SVM, GMM, HMM) with deep learning methods.
- Implemented **ResNet-34 transfer learning** and a **custom CNN**.
- Achieved **93.4% accuracy**, outperforming other methods in literature.

## 📊 Datasets Used
- **TESS (Toronto Emotional Speech Set)**
- **RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)**
- **CREMA-D (Crowd-Sourced Emotional Multimodal Actors Dataset)**
- **SAVEE (Surrey Audio-Visual Expressed Emotion)**
